| 1.0.3     | - Add a configuration option (On by default) that will remove the pin if the player died with an empty inventory.                                                                      |
| 1.0.2     | - Update for Valheim 0.217.22                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1.0.1     | - Provide compatibility with mods, vanilla, etc that turn off the minimap/map. Pins in vanilla do not effectively remove themselves unless the map is open. How dumb is that? oh well. |
| 1.0.0     | - Initial Release                                                                                                                                                                      |
